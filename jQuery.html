        <h1>JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h1>
        <p>Many developers who work with JavaScript rarely use JavaScript alone. Rather, they use libraries and frameworks that abstract out much of the complexity of the underlying language.</p>

                <h3>JQuery</h3>
                <p>jQuery is a popular, free, open-source JavaScript library that makes navigating and manipulating the DOM easier than just using JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Angular</h3>
                <p>Angular, which was developed at Google. The current version is a different framework from AngularJS, which it effectively replaces. They are quite different, AngularJS was based on JavaScript, whereas Angular is built on TypeScript.</p>

                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>Bootstrap was first developed at Twitter and focuses on page presentation, particularly in a mobile context. It is really a CSS library rather than a JavaScript one, but does have features that use JavaScript.</p>
